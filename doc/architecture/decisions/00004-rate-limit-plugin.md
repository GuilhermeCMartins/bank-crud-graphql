# 4. Rate-Limit Plugin for Apollo Server
Date: 2024-11-08

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In a multi-tenant GraphQL application, handling rate-limiting at the server level is essential for protecting against abuse, maintaining performance, and ensuring secure authentication flows. In Apollo Server, errors from rate limits or authentication are sent through the GraphQL response. However, capturing and handling these errors effectively requires additional control to manage token validation and user restrictions. Implementing a rate-limit plugin allows us to intercept and throw specific errors when tokens are invalid, ensuring they are handled and validated correctly.

## Decision
We decided to implement a rate-limit plugin for Apollo Server. This plugin is added at the GraphQL server level, enabling a controlled approach to limit the rate of incoming requests while ensuring that token errors can be thrown and handled in a structured manner.

## Consequences
Using a rate-limit plugin for Apollo Server has several implications:

## Positive Consequences
- Enhanced Security and Stability: The rate-limit plugin prevents overuse or abuse of GraphQL endpoints by enforcing request limits, protecting the server from potential DoS attacks and ensuring fair usage among tenants.
- Controlled Token Validation: By intercepting errors directly in the plugin, we gain control over how token validation errors are handled. This enables us to throw customized exceptions, which are easier to process and validate in the context of our middleware, enhancing authentication security.
- Centralized Management of Rate Limits: Applying rate-limiting at the Apollo Server level ensures that all GraphQL operations are subject to the same rate restrictions, reducing the need to set up individual rate limits on each endpoint.
- Modularity and Extensibility: Additional functionality, such as specific rate limits per tenant or custom error handling logic, can be added to the plugin, making it easy to adapt as requirements change without extensive modifications to individual resolvers.

## Negative Consequences
- Dependence on Contextual Errors: Relying on the plugin to handle and throw token-related errors requires consistent management of the plugin logic. Errors that do not follow the expected format may need additional handling to ensure they are properly thrown and processed.
- Potential Overhead in High Traffic Scenarios: Implementing rate limits can introduce some overhead in high-traffic environments, as each request must be checked against the defined rate limits, potentially impacting response times slightly.

In summary, using a rate-limit plugin for Apollo Server enhances security, simplifies token validation, and ensures rate control at the server level, making it a valuable addition for managing multi-tenant data and secure request handling in a GraphQL environment.
