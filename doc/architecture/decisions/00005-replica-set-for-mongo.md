# 5. MongoDB Replica Set for Transaction Support
Date: 2024-11-08

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In MongoDB, transactions are essential for ensuring data consistency, particularly in multi-tenant applications where multiple related operations should be executed as a single unit. Transactions require a MongoDB replica set configuration, as MongoDB only supports transactions across documents when a replica set is enabled. Using a replica set enables us to leverage multi-document transactions, providing an ACID-compliant environment essential for complex operations that involve multiple collections or documents.

## Decision
We decided to configure a MongoDB replica set in our environment. This setup enables the use of transactions, allowing us to perform complex data operations safely and consistently within a single transaction scope. The replica set will also improve fault tolerance, as data replication across instances helps prevent data loss and ensures high availability.

## Consequences
Using a MongoDB replica set for transaction support has several implications:

## Positive Consequences
- Transactional Support: The replica set enables multi-document transactions, allowing us to perform ACID-compliant operations. This is crucial for handling multi-step processes where data consistency is vital across multiple collections or documents.
- Increased Fault Tolerance: A replica set offers redundancy, replicating data across multiple nodes. In case of a node failure, other members of the set can take over, reducing downtime and preserving data integrity.
- Data Durability: With replica sets, data is more resilient to unexpected failures. Replication across multiple nodes ensures that data remains accessible and durable, even if a single node becomes unavailable.
- Improved Read Scalability: The replica set configuration allows read operations to be distributed across members of the set. This can improve read performance, particularly in high-demand scenarios where data needs to be accessed frequently.

## Negative Consequences
- Increased Operational Complexity: Setting up and managing a replica set adds complexity to the MongoDB configuration. It requires careful monitoring and maintenance to ensure that all nodes are synchronized and operating correctly.
- Higher Resource Usage: Replica sets require additional server instances, which can lead to higher costs for infrastructure and resources. Each node consumes memory, storage, and CPU, which should be considered in the resource planning.
- Potential Latency for Writes: When a replica set is involved, write operations may have slightly increased latency, as writes need to be replicated to other nodes to ensure data consistency. This overhead might impact performance slightly, especially in high-frequency write operations.

In summary, implementing a MongoDB replica set to enable transaction support is essential for maintaining data consistency in a multi-tenant application. While it introduces additional operational complexity, the benefits of fault tolerance, data durability, and transactional integrity make it a valuable component for our applicationâ€™s data infrastructure.
